Codebook describing the variables in tidy_dataset.txt

All the rows represents a sequence of averaged observables for a given subject doing a given activity.


The first two columns identify the subject and the activity done as follows:

ID: integer from 1 to 30 identifying the subject of the given experiment 

activity: character string identifying the activity done by the subject "ID" during the experiment. 
          The possible activities are the following: "Walking", "Walking_up", "Walking_down", "Sitting", "Standing", "Laying".



All the other columns are the averaged values of several registered features for any given subject and any given activity. 
The registered features are described by abbreviations, that can be read as follows:

The initial letter is a "t" or a "f" if the corresponding feature is respectively in the "time" or "frequency" domain.

"BodyAcc" and "GravityAcc" refer respectively to the part of the measured acceleration imputable to the subject mouvement or to the gravity.

The suffix "Mag" refers to the magnitude of the corresponding 3-dimensional vector, calculated using a Euclidean norm.

The features whose name comprehend the part "Gyro" has been measured by making use of a gyroscope.

The Jerk signals of some of the variables have been calculated, and are characterized in the dataset by a "Jerk" part of the name.

The columns referring to a specific direction are suffixed by, respectively, a "X", "Y" or "Z".

Finally, the suffix "mean()" and "std()" depends on the fact that the original data (over which the present dataset perform a subsequent average for
all the (ID, activity) pairs) were means or standard deviations of other raw data, no more reported in this dataset.
